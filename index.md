### CPSC 120


* Lab 4
	
	Lab 4, It was fun because the unit's conversion involved more of how to apply the principles to life, which makes them relatable or useful. It is also enriching to implement the functions in calculating and displaying metric-to-US customary and US customary-to-metric conversions. 


* Lab 7
	Lab 7, I enjoyed this lab because it was practical and focused on real-world scenarios, like implementing parking rules based on time and day. The partner I got with was very helpful and helped me understand new things about writing code. Writing code to handle different conditions for each street was enjoyable to program.


* Lab 9


	Lab 9, I enjoyed this lab because it focused on building a functional spell checker, which felt practical. This lab had me a little confused with what to put in the code, it was a bit hard to understand but it was enjoyable. Writing functions to compare document words with a dictionary and handle input validation was something I didnt think I'd be doing which was enjoyable.
